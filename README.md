# StatusTag

[My Notes](notes.md)

I plan to develop a web application where users can select their current status (e.g., open to talk, eating lunch, in class, TA, or at the library) and view their friends’ current statuses. The application also includes a shared area where users can see each other’s avatars and the specific tasks they are working on in real time. 


## 🚀 Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
College students often have fragmented schedule, making it difficult to know whether friends are available in a given moment. This app allows users to share simple status updates
